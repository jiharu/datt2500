## Topology 
- A surface, a two-dimensional manifold, looks flat in a local view, but it can have a more-interesting global structure.

- Topological objects are categorized by their genus (number of holes).

### Definition

- **Topology is the mathematical study of *shapes* and *spaces*.** It is a major area of mathematics concerned with the most basic properties of space, such as *connectedness*, *continuity* and *boundary*. It is the study of properties that are preserved under continuous deformations including stretching and bending, but not tearing or gluing. Topology developed as a field of study out of geometry and set theory, through analysis of such concepts as space, dimension, and transformation. 

	e.g. a Möbius strip is a kind of object studied in topology which has only one surface and one edge.

- The definition of topology leads to the following mathematical joke (Renteln and Dundes 2005)	
	
	***"What is a topologist?""***  
	***"Someone who cannot distinguish between a doughnut and a coffee cup."*** [Wolfram mathworld](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Topology.html)<!-- [위상이란 무엇인가?](http://mathnmath.tistory.com/39)   -->

	 ![torus](img/Mug_and_Torus_morph.gif)    
	- This gif clip is from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology)

- [Mathworld](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/classroom/TopologicalSpace.html): (1) The mathematical study of object's properties that are preserved through **deformations**, **twistings**, and **stretchings** of objects. Tearing, however, is not allowed. (2) A set along with a collection of subsets that satisfy several defining properties. 

### More examples

There are many surfaces with a variety of looks that are topologically the same.

## Booleans 
Three boolean operations let you combine objects to make shapes that would otherwise be difficult to model using other techniques. You can add, subtract, or intersect objects to create a new, complex shape. [Examples](http://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2016/ENU/?guid=GUID-7DADD144-6C29-4AE3-B877-A9947B2F26E0)

# A. 3D techniques
Reference: [digital] Modeling by William Vaughan, 2011

## No set way

> An interesting fact in the digital modeling world is that no two artists use the same techniques when creating a digital model, even when the two modelers are working from the same reference material, producing the same final mesh. Consider this example: When I had classes of thirty students working on the same robot model, I never saw any two working with the same method. This just goes to show that there is no set way to work, and that artists are free to work with whatever method(s) they feel most comfortable with.

![robots](img/meth/robots.png)

## More methods

> Don’t limit yourself to just a few modeling methods. Every professional digital modeler I know gravitates to a particular method of modeling for the majority of the meshes each is tasked with, but each modeler is quick to use other methods when needed. The more techniques you become proficient in, the more efficient you will become.

## Digtial Sculpting
![scup](img/meth/zbrush.png)    
>No consideration to the layout of polygons is needed when digital sculpting, leaving the artist’s focus on the shapes, not the underlying geometry.  
  
![normal](img/meth/normal.png)    
>The high-poly meshes are used as source material to enhance low-poly models used in real-time games with the use of normal maps.

# Lab 
## Smoothing Polygon surfaces
- [Autodesk: Smoothing polygons](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2016/ENU/Maya/files/GUID-8A5D0FF0-9BA1-435F-A4CA-53183311B819-htm.html) 
	- Smooth a mesh by adding new polygons
	- Smooth mesh preview overview
	- Subdiv proxy overview
	- Smooth a mesh by averaging the distance between vertices
	- Subdivision surface
 
- Other than the ways from the above list, to see a smooth version of a model, you can change its normal direction (Modeling // Mesh Display / Soften Edge) too.

## Subdivision surface

A subdivision surface lets you subdivide specific regions of a mesh, giving you the ability to finely tune or smooth certain areas without changing the entire mesh.

Subdivision surfaces help you keep a lower polygon count because they only insert control points where you need them (instead of uniformly across the entire mesh). However, subdivision surfaces have the slowest performance of the three smoothing methods. 

Note: Subdivision surfaces are largely unsupported in pipelines outside of Maya, so you need to convert them to polygons or NURBS before exporting to these pipelines. You can convert using either Modify > Convert Subdiv to Polygons or Modify > Convert Subdiv to NURBS.
For more information on subdivision surfaces, see the [Subdivision Surfaces documentation archive](http://download.autodesk.com/us/support/files/subds.pdf).

### OpenSubdiv 
OpenSubdiv is an open-source subdivision method developed by Pixar that lets you work with a high-fidelity representation of your model with great accuracy and speed. As a professional standard in the animation industry, OpenSubdiv is implemented in a variety of software packages, improving interoperability by producing the same results when models are transferred between applications. In Maya, OpenSubdiv is the default subdivision method when you preview a smoothed mesh, smooth a mesh using Mesh > Smooth, or create a subdiv proxy.
