------------------------------------

# A.
## Goal

- Understanding Polygon modeling.
- Being able to create polygon geometry and to modify its properties.

------------
# Polygon modeling

![mm01](img/maya/polygon/mm.png)  

Polygons are straight-sided shapes (3 or more sides), defined by three-dimensional points (vertices) and the straight lines that connect them (edges). The interior region of the polygon is called the face. 
When many faces are connected together they create a network of faces called a **polygon mesh** (also referred to as a polyset or a polygonal object).

-------------
## Fundamental
### Polygon component
**Vertices, edges, and faces** are the basic components of polygons. 
When you model with polygons you usually use three-sided polygons called triangles or four-sided polygons called quadrilaterals (quads). Maya also supports the creation of polygons with more than four sides (n-gons) but they are not as commonly used for modeling.

### Normal

![nol01](img/maya/polygon/nor01.png) 

- Vertex normal

![nol01](img/maya/polygon/vn.png)  
You can modify the shading of individual polygons by manually editing the vertex normals associated with the polygon mesh.

- Face normal

### Shading

### Smooth method

### Texturing

![tex01](img/maya/polygon/texturing.png) 

___________________________________
### Creating polygons: using primitives or creating from scratch.
	- Using primitives (Create / Polygon Primitives)
	- Creating Polygon from scratch (Mesh Tools / Create Polygon Tool)    

![pri](img/maya/polygon/primitives.png)

### Two modes:
1. Object mode (transformation + shape + Input node)
2. Component mode (you can edit parts of an object)

### Editing at component mode	
	- Transform vertices, edges, and faces
	- Split faces using snap (Mesh Tools / Multi-Cut) 	
	- Combine or separate meshes
	- Merge vertices, edges, and faces
	- Delete vertices, edges, and faces	
	- Append the deleted faces (Mesh Tools / Append to Polygon)
	- Extrude faces or edges (Edit Mesh / Extrude) 

----------------
### Invalid polygon geometry
Some types of polygon geometry will not work in Maya. Invalid geometry includes vertices that are not associated with a polygon edge and polygon edges that are not part of a face (dangling edges). While Maya does not let you create these types of geometry, it may be possible to import these types from other software applications.

![poly03](img/maya/polygon/mn.png)  

- Converting polygon faces to triangles is a quick way to ensure non-planar faces render properly.    
- Converting polygon faces to quads is a good way to clean up polygons or reduce the number of faces. 

### Two-manifold vs. Non-manifold 

- Polygonal geometry can have different configurations or ***topology*** types in Maya. Understanding the characteristics of these topologies can be helpful when you need to understand why a modeling operation failed to execute as expected.

- **Two-manifold topology polygons** have a configuration such that the polygon mesh can be split along its various edges and subsequently unfolded so that the mesh lays flat without overlapping pieces.

- **Non-manifold topology polygons** have a configuration that cannot be unfolded into a continuous flat piece. Some tools and actions in Maya cannot work properly with non-manifold geometry. For example, the legacy ***Boolean*** algorithm and the ***Reduce*** feature do not work with non-manifold polygon topology. The image below shows three examples of non-manifold topology polygons.

![poly04](img/maya/polygon/manyf.png) 

The following operations in Maya can produce non-manifold geometry:

- Select Faces or Edges and select **Edit Mesh > Extrude.**     
- **Normals > Reverse (without extracting geometry).**  
- **Edit Mesh > Merge Components.**  
- **Delete Face.**  
- **Edit Mesh > Merge Components to Center**  

You can convert non-manifold topology polygons into two-manifold topology (including the less obvious case of adjacent faces with opposite normals) using **Mesh > Cleanup.**

__________
### Modeling Toolkit 

Modeling Toolkit used to be a plug-in called NEX, that has been integrated within Maya since 2014. It integrates component-level selection and editing tools together (such as selecting vertices, edges, faces, etc., and extruding them, for example) for a more streamlined modeling workflow.

-------------------------------
## Lab practice E: Vector rendering 
### Rendering
 
The renderer is where all of your scene data and settings are handed off to the software and render calculations are performed that result in final bitmap images.

## Lab practice F: Low poly in Maya

> basically this is what you need to do. [Reference link](http://simplymaya.com/forum/showthread.php?t=39592)

1. Select all the vertices on your mesh (or the ones you want that applied)
2. Go to Edit Mesh > Transform Component > option box
3. Select the random factor (you can change that later)
4. Move the vertices to the form you want
5. Select the Geo then go to Mesh > Triangulate
6. Select the Mesh again then got to Mesh > Reduce (adjust options for different results)
7. Change the vertex normal: Mesh display > Harden Edge
