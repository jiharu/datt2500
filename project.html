# Project 1 - still life modeling.
## Due date: Oct 16th midnight.

- Please collect your final work and related files into one folder:

	1. The name of folder and files: ```your last name_your first name + numbering``` 
	  
	2. Include in the folder: 
		1. Your final render image: 1k pixels size (the longer is 1024 px), saved as JPG or PNG. 
		2. Your Maya file (.mb or ma file) 
		3. One page documentation PDF file, showing your reference image and a description of your choice and focus.   
	3. Where to submit: please upload your assignment folder (including three documents: one image file, one Maya file, one PDF file) to the [Google drive space](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7x8GrEkHm-LWVEtU1NDNVE4Z00?usp=sharing).
	
	4. Consider the technical and aesthetic challenges. 
	
	5. Here are some example rendering results from previous classes:   
		1. [link to Sogang student portfolio](example.html)  
		2. [link to York student portfolio](portfolio.html)

----------------------------------------

# Project 2 - completion of still life modeling & Project 3 - free theme modeling & rendering 
## Due date: Dec 9th midnight.

- Please complete your 1st project; add shading including UV texturing, lighting with soft shadows, lighting configuration, and high rendering qualities. 
- Regarding the general format and submission guide, check and follow the project 3 guidelines. 
- If you want to work further, you can alter and advance project 1 or completely redo it too. Usually if you make the same object once more, you will find more efficient solutions.  

# Project 3 - free theme modeling & rendering.
## Due date: Dec 9th midnight.

- Please collect your final work and related files into one folder:

	1. The name of folder: ```your school id_your name``` (e.g., 123456_your name)
	
	2. In the main folder, there should be two sub folders: project_2 and project_3.
	  
	3. Include in the each folder: 
		1. Your final render image: at least one side should be 1k pixel size, saved as JPG or PNG. 
		2. Your Maya project folder including only the final Maya file (.mb or ma file) with related materials such as textures. (don't submit with all of your maya files. Once the project is done, delete unused files so that the file size of your final submission is not too large: recommended file size is lesser than 30 mb.)  
		3. One page documentation PDF file, showing a - a description of your choice and focus, b - a process of making and problem solving, and c - your discoveries and achievement. *Project 2 documentation can be shorter than project 3 documentation.   
	4. Where to submit: please upload your assignment folder (including three documents: one image file, one Maya file, one PDF file) to the your lab folder in the [Google drive space](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7x8GrEkHm-LVmlNTjdPSDBlX3M?usp=sharing).
	
	5. Consider the technical and aesthetic challenges plus the level of completion.

## General guide for the final project

- Cleaning the file: proper naming, and delete the history once it is ready.

- Modeling details: Work on good proportion. Adding bevels to smooth edges. Apply smoothing if it is a curved surface. If it is NURBS surface, rebuild it by increasing number of spans, or if it is polygon, either do smooth or smooth proxy, or by manually adding more divisions or edges.

- Cinematography: redefine your camera set-up (file gate) and match it to the render setting (resolution gate). Check that your lighting shows good balance and overall contrast, helps viewers to focus on the main objects, and reveals important details in your scene. Finally try to create good soft shadows.

- Shading & rendering: define and reveal proper material characteristics and when you do render, properly apply ray tracing, direct or indirect illumination if it fits, and most of all don't forget to apply anti-aliasing. Try to use photoshop in order to utilize multiple render passes too.

Overall, work on it until you are pleased with your final render result.
