# A.
## Working as a 3D modeler in the industry  
Reference: [digital] Modeling by William Vaughan, 2011  

###  Advice for becoming a 3D modeler

- **Problem-solving** and **observational skills** are most important: to be successful in this feld, you need to become a problem solver with good observation skills and a desire to create things. You never stop learning in this feld. You face new challenges with every new project, many of which require innovative solutions that you must discover on your own. If you get to a point where you stop seeing these challenges as lessons that help build your ever-growing skill set, it’s probably a sign that you’ve lost your passion for the medium and it may be time to explore other career options.

- **Software:** whether the software is free, cheap, or super expensive, artists are creating amazing pieces of art with it. Don’t get too caught up in software, because throughout your career as a digital artist you will most likely use various modeling and sculpting applications. Each comes with its own workfow, but the core fundamentals of modeling stay the same. 

- **Job Market:** according to the BLS (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics), the job market for multimedia artists and animators was expected to grow 8% from 2010-2020. With large numbers of self-employed 3D artists and the intense competition for salaried positions, earnings vary widely and are difficult to predict. The BLS reported that the median annual salary for multimedia artists and animators was US$61,370 in May 2012. [-Educational Portal](http://education-portal.com/articles/3D_Artists_Job_Description_and_Career_Outlook_for_a_3D_Artist.html)

### Understanding a modeler’s role 

- It’s all about teamwork. To truly master digital modeling, you must be aware of all aspects of production and understand how they are connected. Projects that require digital modeling come in all shapes and sizes, and can require a team made up of just one artist or hundreds of artists.

- Art of Maya [pdf link](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parent/classes/682/MAYA/art_of_maya.pdf)

	>In The Art of Maya, every page is full of diagrams and illustrations.. The diagrams describe the computer graphic concepts in a way that will help you understand how you can use Maya in your own work. - google books.

	This book is an excellent resource for all Maya users and includes an introduction to computer graphics that will help people new to the world of 3D animation (and 3D modeling).

# D. Review
## What is digital modeling?  

- **Digital modeling (3D model, 3D mesh, or  3D modeling)** refers to the process of creating a mathematical representation of a three-dimensional shape of an object. You can create 3D models manually, or by generating them, or by automatically scanning objects.

- You can see 3D graphics literally everywhere these days. Digital modelers work in television and feature films, game design, medical illustration and animation, print graphics, product and architectural visualization, and many other markets.

## Differences between real-time and non real-time animation (offline rendering)

### Real-time
- Rendering for interactive media, such as games and simulations, is calculated and displayed immediately. 
- It uses the viewer's PC processor and graphics card to produce individual frames of animation as they are displayed.

### Non real-time
- Animations for non-interactive media, such as feature films and video, are rendered much more slowly and presented as video files.
- Non-real time rendering enables the leveraging of limited processing power in order to obtain higher image quality.

# E. Lab
## To do list
- Get familiar with the Maya interface.

--------------------

## Maya Interface

- [Maya help: interface overview](http://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2016/ENU/?guid=GUID-F4FCE554-1FA5-447A-8835-63EB43D2690B)

	- Complete Maya Programming: An Extensive Guide to MEL and the C++ API, 2003    

>A solid foundation in the fundamental Maya concepts will greatly ease your development efforts.  Maya allows you to "do it the wrong way." Since the Maya framework is extremely flexible, it rarely places strict guidelines on how you should achieve a particular task. This is extremely attractive, since almost any problem can be tackled from a variety of different angles.

Maya has **a very flexible workflow** which doesn't impose many constraints. For the most part there is more than one way to approach a particular problem. This means that you can use whichever approach is most suited to your needs. In time, you will learn **how to create your very own custom workflows**.
