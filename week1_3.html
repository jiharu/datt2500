# A. 

### Virtual vs. real space

## 3-D world
The 3D world in computer graphics applications is visualized using a Cartesian coordinate system.

------------
## Basic Modeling
  
> Modeling on a conventional computer can be a challenge at first because the goal is to mimic 3D objects on a 2D screen; 3D artists need to learn how to use manipulators and different view panels to navigate the virtual space so they can focus on sculpting and building their models.

## Overview of NURBS, Polygon, Subdivision modeling
   

> Using one of several geometry types, 3D artists can build surfaces, then push and pull points to change their shape.

### NURBS
NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) are one geometry type you can use to create 3D curves and surfaces in Maya. 
NURBS are useful for constructing many types of organic 3D forms because of the smooth and minimal nature of the curves they use to construct surfaces. NURBS surface types are widely used in the fields of animation, games, scientific visualization, and industrial design.

### Polygon
Polygons are straight-sided shapes (3 or more sides), defined by three-dimensional points (vertices) and the straight lines that connect them (edges). The interior region of the polygon is called the face. 
When many faces are connected together they create a network of faces called a polygon mesh (also referred to as a polyset or a polygonal object).

### Primitives in Maya

![pri](img/maya/polygon/primitives.png)   

### Differences between NURBS and polygon surfaces

The difference between NURBS surfaces and polygon objects is similar to the difference between vector images and pixel-based images in 2D drawing programs. NURBS surfaces are like vector images in that they are surfaces interpolated from resolution-independent curves. Polygon objects are similar to pixel-based images in that they are dependent on the number of polygon faces for their resolution.

-------------------

## Topology 
- A surface, a two-dimensional manifold, looks flat in a local view, but it can have a more-interesting global structure.

- Topological objects are categorized by their genus (number of holes).

### Definition

- **Topology is the mathematical study of *shapes* and *spaces*.** It is a major area of mathematics concerned with the most basic properties of space, such as *connectedness*, *continuity* and *boundary*. It is the study of properties that are preserved under continuous deformations including stretching and bending, but not tearing or gluing. Topology developed as a field of study out of geometry and set theory, through analysis of such concepts as space, dimension, and transformation. 

	e.g. a Möbius strip is a kind of object studied in topology which has only one surface and one edge.

	- The gif clip is from [Mobius from mathcurve.com](http://www.mathcurve.com/surfaces/mobius/mobius.shtml)
	
- The definition of topology leads to the following mathematical joke (Renteln and Dundes 2005)	
	
	***"What is a topologist?""***  
	***"Someone who cannot distinguish between a doughnut and a coffee cup."*** [Wolfram mathworld](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Topology.html), [위상이란 무엇인가?](http://mathnmath.tistory.com/39)   

	 ![torus](img/Mug_and_Torus_morph.gif)    
	- This gif clip is from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology)

- [Mathworld](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/classroom/TopologicalSpace.html): (1) The mathematical study of object's properties that are preserved through **deformations**, **twistings**, and **stretchings** of objects. Tearing, however, is not allowed. (2) A set along with a collection of subsets that satisfy several defining properties. 

### More examples

There are many surfaces with a variety of looks that are topologically the same.

## Booleans 
Three boolean operations let you combine objects to make shapes that would otherwise be difficult to model using other techniques. You can add, subtract, or intersect objects to create a new, complex shape. [Examples](http://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2016/ENU/?guid=GUID-7DADD144-6C29-4AE3-B877-A9947B2F26E0)

# C. Recess

_______________

# D. Review
- Survey result, Maya, and Tumblr 
- [assignment](http://2016ant3012.tumblr.com)

-----------------

# E. Lab
## To do list 
- Lab practice A: Preparation for the project
- Lab practice B: Build a robot using Maya primitives 

--------------------

## Lab practice A: preparation for the project
### Project set-up: ***Project Window***.    

![pr00](img/maya/interface/project.png)  

### Preference Set-up: the number of ***undo***s
![pr01](img/maya/interface/pref.png)

### Tip
- ***Save your scene file often! Maya do crash!*** 

----------------------

### Navigating display windows

- View panel change (Space Bar or check the left area layout) : Single View vs. Four View
- Perspective View + Orthographic View
- Tumble, Track, Dolly Tool (Alt (option) + Mouse Button (left, middle, right button))    

------------------------
### Editing
- Object mode vs editing (component) mode
- Viewing or managing *manipulator* to transform
- Changing the *pivot*, which is a center of manipulator (***insert*** key, or ***fn + left*** arrow key, or ***d*** key)

____________
### Hierarchy relation
#### View panel
Check out objects in the scene. Each modeling object is consisted with transform and shape nodes. You can control their hierarchical relations in these windows:  

- Outliner window
- Hypergraph window

#### Group vs. parent

![hir03](img/maya/hier01.png) 
____________
## Lab practice B: your simple robot
### What you will build:
![sim01](img/lab/sim_rob.png) 
Perspective view.  

![sim02](img/lab/rob.png)
Four plane view.  

### What/How to do
1. Make sure that you set-up the project so that you know where your scene file will be located.   
2. Create new scene and save it.  
3. Go to the Front view to start. Check the grid location and size. 
4. Create primitives: boxes, cylinders, and spheres.
5. Move, rotate, and scale them checking side and top view. 
6. Check and work in between perspective and orthogonal views.  
7. To move the rims, you need to group or parent.
8. Duplicate rims and an eye. You can use scale to find their symmetric position.

________________________
## Lab work to do
1. Review on today's lecture & lab class material.
2. Preparation for the project
3. Build a robot using Maya primitives (Your assignment will be recreating your robot based on your sketch or proportion).

-----------------------------
# F. Assignment

- Rebuild your robot using Maya primitives (prepare your sketch to refine proportion) and upload it to Tumblr.  
- Review ***Art of Maya*** [pdf link](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parent/classes/682/MAYA/art_of_maya.pdf) p16~17: 3D Space, p32~33: Transformations, p42~43: Geometry, p44~45: Modeling Techniques.
