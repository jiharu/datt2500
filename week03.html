# Surface modeling
## Overview of NURBS, Polygon, Subdivision modeling
   
Using one of several geometry types, 3D artists can build surfaces, then push and pull points to change their shape.

*- Art of Maya, p43.*

### NURBS
NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) are one geometry type you can use to create 3D curves and surfaces in Maya. 
NURBS are useful for constructing many types of organic 3D forms because of the smooth and minimal nature of the curves they use to construct surfaces. NURBS surface types are widely used in the fields of animation, games, scientific visualization, and industrial design.

### Polygon
Polygons are straight-sided shapes (3 or more sides), defined by three-dimensional points (vertices) and the straight lines that connect them (edges). The interior region of the polygon is called the face. 
When many faces are connected together they create a network of faces called a polygon mesh (also referred to as a polyset or a polygonal object).

### Primitives in Maya

![pri](img/maya/polygon/primitives.png)   

### Differences between NURBS and polygon surfaces

The difference between NURBS surfaces and polygon objects is similar to the difference between vector images and pixel-based images in 2D drawing programs. NURBS surfaces are like vector images in that they are surfaces interpolated from resolution-independent curves. Polygon objects are similar to pixel-based images in that they are dependent on the number of polygon faces for their resolution.

# NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines)
[Maya help: NURBS overview](http://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2016/ENU//?guid=GUID-5EC05798-3F28-4AD2-8154-36BC444A4DC9)

## NURBS
**Non-uniform rational basis spline (NURBS)** is a mathematical model commonly used in computer graphics for generating and representing curves and surfaces. It offers great flexibility and precision for handling both analytic (surfaces defined by common mathematical formulae) and modeled shapes. NURBS are commonly used in computer-aided design (CAD), manufacturing (CAM), and engineering (CAE) and are part of numerous industry wide standards.   
[wikipedia: Non-uniform rational B-spline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_rational_B-spline)

## Terminology 

	NURBS, CV (Control Vertex), EP (Edit Point), start of curve, curve direction,  
	curve degree, hull, span, knot spacing..  
		  
### In Maya	
>Maya calls any NURBS curve simply a “curve.” In some menus, Maya will refer to a surface created from curves as a “surface” and sometimes as “NURBS,” such as in the 'Modify/Convert' menu. Although other 3D programs might have more than one type of spline technology, you should know that even though Maya sometimes drops the word “NURBS,” we are still dealing with this technology whenever we use “curves” and “surfaces” within Maya.

## Components
The components of the NURBS surface are very similar to those of the NURBS curve. NURBS surfaces have CVs, hulls and spans which define the shape of a four-sided surface. NURBS models, whether they are organic or industrial in nature, are generally made up of several adjoining four-sided patches. As with the NURBS curve, it is desirable to define surfaces with the fewest evenly spaced isoparms or CVs. The quality and type of curve will affect the characteristics of the surface.
