# NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines)
[NURBS overview](http://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2016/ENU//?guid=GUID-5EC05798-3F28-4AD2-8154-36BC444A4DC9)

## NURBS
**Non-uniform rational basis spline (NURBS)** is a mathematical model commonly used in computer graphics for generating and representing curves and surfaces. It offers great flexibility and precision for handling both analytic (surfaces defined by common mathematical formulae) and modeled shapes. NURBS are commonly used in computer-aided design (CAD), manufacturing (CAM), and engineering (CAE) and are part of numerous industry wide standards.   
[wikipedia: Non-uniform rational B-spline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_rational_B-spline)

## Terminology 

	NURBS, CV (Control Vertex), EP (Edit Point), hull, span, 
	cv curve tool, ep curve tool, Start of curve, curve direction,  
	Curve degree, Knot spacing..  
		  
### In Maya	
>Maya calls any NURBS curve simply a “curve.” In some menus, Maya will refer to a surface created from curves as a “surface” and sometimes as “NURBS,” such as in the 'Modify/Convert' menu. Although other 3D programs might have more than one type of spline technology, you should know that even though Maya sometimes drops the word “NURBS,” we are still dealing with this technology whenever we use “curves” and “surfaces” within Maya.

## Edit mode: surface and curve component types
The components of the NURBS surface are very similar to those of the NURBS curve. NURBS surfaces have CVs, hulls and spans which define the shape of a four-sided surface. NURBS models, whether they are organic or industrial in nature, are generally made up of several adjoining four-sided patches. As with the NURBS curve, it is desirable to define surfaces with the fewest evenly spaced isoparms or CVs. The quality and type of curve will affect the characteristics of the surface.

## Lab practice B: Editing curves
## Curve Editing

### Editing CVs & EP
- To modify, use the F8 key, Marking menu with right mouse button, or select icon from the menu. 

![curve](img/lab/curves.png) 

### Detaching & attaching curves
- Splits a curve into two new curves.
(Curves / Detach)

![curve01](img/maya/nurbs/curve/detach.png)

- Joins NURBS curves together at their endpoints to form a new curve. You can select two or more curves for attaching.
(Curves / Attach)

## Lab practice C: Creating surfaces	
### Revolve

### Loft

### Birail
- Creates a surface by sweeping between a series of profile curves along two path curves. The resulting surface can maintain continuity with other surfaces. The Birail Tool has options for sweeping 1, 2, or 3 (or more) cross sectional curves along the two path (rail) curves. The resulting surface is interpolated through the profile curves. (Surfaces / [Birail](http://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2016/ENU//index.html?guid=GUID-E9C6BCFF-261A-4E8E-8139-468A57E0E0D4))

### Boundary
- Creates a surface by filling between boundary curves. (Surfaces / Boundary)

### Bevel
- Creates beveled transition surfaces from a profile curve. (Surfaces / Bevel)

## Lab practice F: Creating Wine glass - Revolve
Technical rigor and aesthetic concern: ***design*** and ***proportion***.
**Proportion:** the ratio of one quantity to another, especially the ratio of a part compared to a whole. In a mathematical context, a proportion is the statement of equality between two ratios.
[proportion: architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportion_(architecture)),
[proportion: body](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_proportions)
