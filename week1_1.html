# 3D Modeling

## Goal

- Understanding what is 3D modeling data, what it is used for, and how to use it
- Elaborate your practice through observation, sensitivity, and expression

## 2D & 3D

## 3D modeling

In 3D computer graphics, 3D modeling (or modelling) is the process of developing a (mathematical) representation of any three-dimensional surface of an object via specialized software. The product is called a 3D model. It can be displayed as a two-dimensional image through a process called 3D rendering or used in a computer simulation of physical phenomena. Recently, it can be displayed as a three-dimensional object through VR display. The model can also be physically created using 3D printing devices.

Models may be created in many different ways automatically or manually. The manual modeling process of preparing geometric data for 3D computer graphics is similar to plastic arts such as sculpting. You also can use various algorithms to generate 3D geometric data.

There is [Sculptris](http://pixologic.com/sculptris/), a free digital sculpting tool from the Pixologic, you might try.

## How to get 3D modeling data

- By scanning in, downloading, or **by creating.** 

## Uses of 3D modeling

3D modeling is used in various industries such as film, animation, gaming, interior design, virtual reality, and architecture. It is also used in the medical industry for the interactive representation of anatomy. A wide number of 3D software are also used in constructing digital representations of mechanical models or parts before they are manufactured. CAD/CAM related software are used in such fields, and with these software, not only can you construct the parts, but also assemble them, and observe their functionality.

3D modelling is also used in the field of Industrial design, wherein products are 3D modeled before representing them to the clients. In media and event industries, 3D modelling is used in stage/set design. 

## Grouping by its use

1. How to display: virtual or physical
2. Depends on its use: non-real or real time. 
3. Modeling or animation: images or sequences.
4. How to create: manual or automatic (conventional or procedural)

	- You can download the next:
		- Getting Started with Maya 2015 Lesson Files (zip - 123Mb)   
	 	- Exploring Maya tutorial scene files (zip – 165,098Kb)

- More to check:
	- If Adobe photoshop opens in your computer.
	- Internet connection & protect your files.
	
## Maya reference 
You can find more references from the course syllabus.

[Maya 2016 online Help](http://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2016/ENU//)    

- Art of Maya [pdf link](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parent/classes/682/MAYA/art_of_maya.pdf)

>In The Art of Maya, every page is full of diagrams and illustrations.. The diagrams describe the computer graphic concepts in a way that will help you understand how you can use Maya in your own work. - google books.

This book is an excellent resource for all Maya users and includes an introduction to computer graphics that will help people new to the world of 3D animation (and 3D modeling). 
	
-----------------------------
# F. Assignment

- Please **upload your first greeting/note to the Tumblr class portfolio** (either in Korean, or in English).    

- Watch five out of the list of [Maya 1-Minute Startup Movies](http://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/ENU/123112/files/maya-1-minute-videos-html.html):    

	- Zoom, pan and roll: Navigation essentials
