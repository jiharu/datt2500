# Production pipeline
Reference: [digital] Modeling Chapter 1 Introduction.
## Stages of production

- 3 Stages: no matter the size of the team or project, you will need a strong production pipeline.   
	
>  ![3 Stages](img/pipeline.png)    

- __Pre-production:__ the pre-production stage is the process of preparing all the elements involved in a production and is the foundation of the project—the blueprint of the entire animation. The story and visual look of a project is developed at this stage, as well as the overall planning of the production.   
 
- __Production:__ the production phase of the project is where final elements of the animation are initially created based on the work developed by the pre-production crew. It is the production crew’s job to stay true to the blueprint in place and to maintain the director’s vision. It’s also where the digital modeler comes into play in most production pipelines.

- __Post-production:__ the post-production is the part of the process that may take the longest due to the refinement of all of the aspects of the final product. Although this is the last step in the production of an animation, it is key to a project’s success. Images get enhanced by compositing, the sound track and dialogue get tighter, and the edit gets tweaked for the most effective presentation of story and pacing. This is the point of the project that can make or break it and should not be taken lightly. It is what the production team loses the most sleep over.

# Character modeling
## Organic modeling
- Organic-looking surfaces are much harder to generate than most hard modeling. 
- Organic surfaces require complex irregularity. 

------------------------------

## Strategies to work with complex modeling
- Understand the 3D pipeline so that you can make a good plan of how to build your modeling data based on how it will be used.  
- Break a complex reference’s shape down into smaller, simpler ones: whatever basic shapes are easier for shaping the model, for example, cylinders, cubes, cones, spheres, pipes and so on.  

------------
## Methods

- You can employ build-out modeling. From a single polygon, you can extrude edges to create smaller sections of a larger object. For example, box modeling allows you to start with a simple primitive that you can extrude to create a complex form.

- When you work on a character or any other modeling which has symmetry, you can create half of it and then mirror it.

- Sculpt polygons. Artisan is a brush-based modeling and editing toolset. Using Artisan, you can sculpt directly on the surface of geometry (You might also apply various deformation tools and soft selection function for your select tool).

- Use retopology tools. Highly detailed, sculpted models are impractical to take through the production pipeline. Instead, the high-resolution model is retopologized to a lower, more manageable resolution.

## Fundamental tools for good modeling
- Collect good references
- Observational skill
- Problem solving

---------------------------

## Fundamental preparation

- Develop a characteristic story 
- Rough sketches and collecting references
- Understand different 3D modeling methods and choose one based on your needs.
- Prepare the blueprints of a 'T'-posed character.

## Styles of model
- Photo-realistic
- Stylized

# Anatomy and proportion 

![davinci](img/Da_Vinci.jpg)  
Vitruvian Man, Leonardo da Vinci around 1490.  

This drawing is accompanied by notes based on the work of the architect Vitruvius. The drawing, which is in pen and ink on paper, depicts a man in two superimposed positions with his arms and legs apart and inscribed in a circle and square. The drawing and text are sometimes called the ***Canon of Proportions*** or, less often, ***Proportions of Man***. [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvian_Man)

## Cinematic vs game model
Models built for interactive 3D are primarily polygonal models that use controlled polygon counts to suit gaming engines. Some next-generation game engines already have support for Bezier geometry, and NURBS and Subdivision surfaces may soon follow.

## Good character design
Reference: Creative character design by Bryan Tillman, 2011, Focal Press  

- Archetypes: a hero, a beauty, a bad guy.., or part of yourself   
	- Character bio: name, age, height, weight, build, nationality..   
- Story and target audience: *the character is always in service to the story*   
- Shapes: they can tell a story about the character visually.  
- Reference    
- Aesthetics & Details  
- Originality

## Lab practice B: Organic modeling

![crpo04](img/maya/polygon/eye05.png)  

### Strategy of organic modeling:    
- Working with symmetry.
- Using image planes to bring in reference sketches.
- Using four-sided polygons and edge loop.
- Maintaining polygons of relatively uniform size + numbers in pair and aspect ratio.
- Decomposing complex forms into simpler subcomponents, also known as block modeling.

### Reference image

![ri01](img/maya/shading/texturing/face_front.jpg) ![ri02](img/maya/shading/texturing/face_side.jpg) 

### Toolsets:    
#### Start
- Crete polygons **(Modeling // Mesh Tools / Create Polygon)**
- Tip: Using a grid to check general size and proportions **(Display / Grid)**
- Using Extrude to expand polygon faces **(Modeling // Edit Mesh / Extrude)**,
Tip: Check **Keep Faces Together**: this option ensures that edges do not separate as they are extruded. 
- Create eyeballs **(Create / NURBS Primitives / Sphere)**
- Tip: Using **Poly Count** and **Outliner** to check your Polygon data **(Display / Heads Up Display / Poly Count)**
- Tip: **"g"** key for previous command

#### Edit
- Using component mode to move vertices and edges, tip: using selection tool **(Modeling // Select)**
- Using Lattice deformer **(Modeling // Deform / Lattice)**
- Using Sculpt tool **(Modeling // Mesh Tools / Sculpting Tools)**

#### Combine two meshes (eye and nose)
- Combine multiple geometries to one **(Modeling // Mesh / Combine)**
- Create faces between geometries **(Modeling // Mesh Tools / Append to Polygon Tool)**
- Divide faces **(Modeling // Mesh Tools / Multi-Cut)**

#### Create symmetry
- Align vertices at the center:   
	- choose all vertices at the center from top or front view.   
	- Snap to grid, tip: turn off Retain component spacing in the Move tool attribute editor. 

Check the image:

![move](img/maya/polygon01/movetool.png) 

- Mirror & Merge the geometry **(Modeling // Mesh / Mirror Geometry)**

![move](img/maya/polygon01/merge.png) 

#### Smoothing Polygon surfaces
- To see a smooth version of the model, choose (Modeling // Mesh Display / Soften Edge)
- Or create Subdivision sufaces using Subdiv Proxy  **(Modeling // Mesh / Smooth Proxy)**
