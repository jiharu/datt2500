# 3D Modeling

## Goal

- Understanding what is 3D modeling data, what it is used for, and how to use it  

## 2D & 3D

## 3D modeling

In 3D computer graphics, **3D modeling (or modelling) is the process of developing a (mathematical) representation of any three-dimensional surface of an object** via specialized software. The product is called a 3D model. It can be displayed as a two-dimensional image through a process called 3D rendering or used in a computer simulation of physical phenomena. Recently, it can be displayed as a three-dimensional object through VR display. The model can also be physically created using 3D printing devices.

Models may be created in many different ways. The manual modeling process of preparing geometric data for 3D computer graphics is similar to plastic arts such as sculpting. You also can use various algorithms to generate 3D geometric data.

## How to get 3D modeling data

- By scanning in, downloading, or **by creating.** 

## Uses of 3D modeling

3D modeling is used in various industries such as film, animation, gaming, interior design, virtual reality, and architecture. It is also used in the medical industry for the interactive representation of anatomy. A wide number of 3D software are also used in constructing digital representations of mechanical models or parts before they are manufactured. CAD/CAM related software are used in such fields, and with these software, not only can you construct the parts, but also assemble them, and observe their functionality.

3D modelling is also used in the field of Industrial design, wherein products are 3D modeled before representing them to the clients. In media and event industries, 3D modelling is used in stage/set design. 

## Grouping by its use

1. How to display: virtual or physical
2. Depends on its use: non-real or real time. 
3. Modeling or animation: images or sequences.
4. How to create: manual or automatic (conventional or procedural)

# Working as a 3D modeler in the industry  
Reference: [digital] Modeling by William Vaughan, 2011  

##  Advice for becoming a 3D modeler

- **Problem-solving** and **observational skills** are most important: to be successful in this feld, you need to become a problem solver with good observation skills and a desire to create things. You never stop learning in this feld. You face new challenges with every new project, many of which require innovative solutions that you must discover on your own. If you get to a point where you stop seeing these challenges as lessons that help build your ever-growing skill set, it’s probably a sign that you’ve lost your passion for the medium and it may be time to explore other career options.

- **Software:** whether the software is free, cheap, or super expensive, artists are creating amazing pieces of art with it. Don’t get too caught up in software, because throughout your career as a digital artist you will most likely use various modeling and sculpting applications. Each comes with its own workfow, but the core fundamentals of modeling stay the same. 

- **Job Market:** according to the BLS (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics), the job market for multimedia artists and animators was expected to grow 8% from 2010-2020. With large numbers of self-employed 3D artists and the intense competition for salaried positions, earnings vary widely and are difficult to predict. The BLS reported that the median annual salary for multimedia artists and animators was US$61,370 in May 2012. [-Educational Portal](http://education-portal.com/articles/3D_Artists_Job_Description_and_Career_Outlook_for_a_3D_Artist.html)

## Understanding a modeler’s role 

- It’s all about teamwork. To truly master digital modeling, you must be aware of all aspects of production and understand how they are connected. Projects that require digital modeling come in all shapes and sizes, and can require a team made up of just one artist or hundreds of artists.

[Maya 2016 online Help](http://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2016/ENU//)    

- Art of Maya [pdf link](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parent/classes/682/MAYA/art_of_maya.pdf)

>In The Art of Maya, every page is full of diagrams and illustrations.. The diagrams describe the computer graphic concepts in a way that will help you understand how you can use Maya in your own work. - google books.

This book is an excellent resource for all Maya users and includes an introduction to computer graphics that will help people new to the world of 3D animation (and 3D modeling).

Maya has **a very flexible workflow** which doesn't impose many constraints. For the most part there is more than one way to approach a particular problem. This means that you can use whichever approach is most suited to your needs. In time, you will learn **how to create your very own custom workflows**.
