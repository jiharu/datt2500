## Expanded Course Description 

The 3D modeling class is designed for students to learn both practical and theoretical knowledge in constructing and managing 3-dimensional modeling and texturing data. It is a highly interdisciplinary and complex subject of artistic expression and technological understanding, therefore needing a creative open mindset from students. Throughout the class, there will be three projects to help students build problem-solving abilities toward the subject in an incremental way. 

Each class consists of one hour of lecture and two hours of lab practice to accomplish theoretical and practical approaches. The main software used in the class is Autodesk Maya, which has very strong support for modeling as well as other related stages of the production pipeline.

The level of the course covers beginner to intermediate modeling and shading. Evaluation will be mainly via three projects and minor assignments taking a creative approach to expressive 3D modeling and texturing.

## Course objectives

-  To build a framework of skills and vocabulary to create and modify 3D modeling data.   
-  To understand the fundamental components and their position in the production pipeline of 3D modeling artwork.   
-  To appreciate the interdisciplinary research attitudes of art and technology (computer graphics).   
-  To invest independent and artistic expression along with problem solving processes during construction.   
-  To develop awareness of current 3D modeling practices through diverse examples of animation, films, video games, virtual worlds, 3D printing, and so on.  

### Students will learn

Understanding 3D computer graphics / various kinds of digital modeling methods / Maya interface and structure / Maya NURBs, polygon, subdivision modeling / shading including texturing / UV (texture mapping) / deformers & shape blending / digital cinematography / lighting & rendering / global illumination / ambient occlusion shading & depth of field.

## Course format

This class is highly practice based. One-third of the class will be lecture-based, showing theory and practice using presentation media and demonstration (33%). The other two-thirds will be supervised students’ hands-on practice (66%). 

-  Please be patient to repeat practice exercises until you feel familiar with the logic & structure of the 3D software interface, pipeline, processes, and vocabularies, since complexities can easily overwhelm. If you have any question or difficulty in following, don’t hesitate to ask the instructor.   
-  Develop your unique preference as a maker/producer among a variety of 3D modeling techniques.   
-  If you have high fluency using 3D software, then investigate near future trends.   
-  When you research examples of 3D artworks, try to avoid popular mass productions such as Pixar’s or DreamWorks’; instead find a specific modeler and investigate his/her portfolio as an independent artist.   
-  Explore many usages of 3D modeling in different areas such as entertainment, education, medical, manufacture, and so on.   
-  Sharing information is recommended to accelerate the speed of progress, unless it interrupts other students’ concentration. Students will share their assignments through the Tumblr website [http://2016datt2500.tumblr.com/](http://2016datt2500.tumblr.com/). Questions and discussions are encouraged during class time.   

## Grade Breakdown
- Project 1- Still life modeling (20%)  
- Project 2- Still life shading & rendering (20%)  
- Project 3- Free theme scene modeling & rendering (40%)  	
- Assigments (20%)   

Failure to complete any project, assignment or to participate in lectures and lab practice will result in failure of the class. It is mandatory for all students to adhere to the course schedule. 

The evaluation will be based on cumulative achievement, regular attendance and the student’s participation in research, making, and creative expression. It is expected that students will show a commitment to completing all projects and assignments with creative & aesthetic solutions based consistent work habits both in class time and outside of class time. 

*** Please Note: The last day to drop this course without receiving a grade is the last day of classes.** 

## Evaluation/Grading Criteria
- Quality of the work produced; with the balance of the student’s artistic expression & sensitivity as well as technical understanding, with integration of techniques and subject.  
- Ability to use 3D modeling techniques and to solve problems into the process of making.  
- The progress and engagement of the student in their research studies, as well as their curiosity and motivation to learn and achieve.  
- The degree and details to which students can set challenges for her or himself.  
- Commitment (includes attendance, participation, completing work on time, ambition of project)    

When you submit your work, please **name your assignment as the following format: last name_first name_date_assignment number.extension**

###Project Description:  
More details regarding projects and assignments will be announced in class. 

-	**Project 1- Still life modeling:** Based on a chosen reference of a masterwork of still life (painting or a photograph), reconstruct via 3D modeling with proper lighting and shadows. Submit a best-quality rendered image along with the reference image you have chosen, and a brief explanation of both, to Moodle. (20%)
-	**Project 2- Still life shading & rendering:** Continuation and completion of project 1 applying proper shaders with textures and cinematographic set-up including camera, lights, and shadows. Details will be announced in class. (20%)  
-	**Project 3- Free theme scene modeling & rendering:** details will be announced in class. (40%)  
-	**Assignments:** simple hands-on practices designed to help students’ progress following each 3D modeling subtopic. Completion in time and proper targeting to the subject are the two evaluation criteria. (20%)

## Computer Lab

There will be general introduction from  the lab technician in the first class. Please clean your seat and log out before you leave for a next lab session. If you have a question about using lab, address it to the lab technician or instructor.
Please turn your cell phones off before entering class and/or the computer lab. 

It is expected that the majority of the assignments will be completed outside of class time. **If you plan to use the lab outside of your class time, you must purchase a Digital Media Lab Card.** Lab Cards are $30 for the year, or $20 for one term. The Digital Media Lab Card can be purchased in the Digital Media office, located in Rm. 232, Goldfarb Centre for Fine Arts. The office is open Monday to Friday, 8:30am-4:30pm. 

Students will be required to supply headphones in the lab to follow web tutorials.
