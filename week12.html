# Rendering for composition
## Mental Ray rendering

Rendering is the final step of the 3D animation pipeline and its quality is crucial to the strong completion of your project. There are many techniques to create better quality  rendering. In particular, you can save time and energy and control your rendering result in detail by splitting up renders based on objects or shading components. You can even separate shadows from the rest of the scene or temporarily assign objects to specialized materials through the Render Layer Editor.

## Ambient Occlusion 

**Ambient occlusion** refers to the attenuation of indirect or diffuse light on an object. It refers to the darker areas of the object such as creases, cracks and crevices. Ambient occlusion is caused by indirect light's inability to bounce around and illuminate areas that are blocked by a nearby object that absorbs the light rays. **These subtle variations in lighting are visual clues for our eyes to detect surface details and distinctions** that would otherwise be washed out and unnoticeable. Ambient occlusion adds realism to your scene by adding shadows in crevices, nooks and crannies, and so on. For each surface point, it calculates how much light is blocked by other geometry.

In the example below, the ice blocks stand out because of the shadowing between them. The cracks between the ice bricks appear darker because the light is blocked by the ice bricks' local geometry.

![ao01](img/maya/rendering/comp_occlusion_rays_2.png)

### Usage
When ambient light is used, objects in your scene may appear to be too bright and geometric detail may become lost. Ambient occlusion solves this problem by subtracting ambient light and thus adding shadowing.

### Baking a texture
#### Batch rendering
A batch file is a set of commands given to the computer to do, one after another. Using batch files, you can queue several rendering tasks at the same time, so that once one is finished, the next starts rendering. With batch rendering, the rendering often occurs on a different thread. This means that it is running as if it were a different program in the background, so Maya allows you to keep working while the batch is rendering.

## Creating Textures with the Transfer Maps Tool
Reference: Advanced Maya® Texturing and Lighting, Second Edition by Lee Lanier, 2008

The Transfer Maps tool can create normal maps and displacement maps by comparing surfaces. In addition, the tool can bake lighting and texturing information.

### Normal map

### Displacement map
![trnsm02](img/maya/rendering/disp_ref.png) 

### Baking lighting and shading information

You can "bake" lighting, texture, and shadow information with the Transfer Maps tool. In this situation, a textured source creates a color bitmap for a target surface. The Transfer Maps tool provides several attributes to choose from for this operation: Diffuse Color Map, Lit And Shaded Color Map, and Alpha Map.

## Depth of Field
Reference: Advanced Maya® Texturing and Lighting, Second Edition by Lee Lanier, 2008

Depth of field is the range of distances that encompass objects that appear acceptably sharp. Due to the optical nature of real-world lenses and the physical qualities of the atmosphere, photography and videography rarely produce images that are 100 percent in focus. In contrast, 3D renders are always in perfect focus unless artificial depth of field is used. 

You can activate Maya's depth of field by checking the Depth Of Field attribute in the Depth Of Field section of the camera's Attribute Editor tab. 

![dof00](img/maya/rendering/dof.png)    
[View the depth of field effect in Viewport 2.0](http://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2016/ENU/?guid=GUID-93DFCF2E-1B24-4C4C-89FD-4C4C202746ED)   

![dof01](img/maya/rendering/dof01.png)  

The F Stop attribute roughly approximates the f-stop of real-world cameras. F-stop is a number that represents the ratio between the diameter of the lens aperture and the focal length of the lens. F-stops are scaled by an approximate factor of 1.4 (for example, f/1.4, f/2, f/2.8, and so on). Each increased f-stop halves the open area of the aperture, halves the amount of light striking the film, and increases the depth of field. The f-stop isn't the only factor to influence depth of field, however. Depth of field is inversely proportional to the focal length of the lens and directly proportional to the distance from the camera to the subject.
 
![dof02](img/maya/rendering/dof02.png)  
The Distance tool used to determine the focus distance.
   
![dof03](img/maya/rendering/dof03.png)   
An artificial depth of field is constructed by masking multiple copies of a render and applying different strength Gaussian blurs.

## Advanced topic: render layers and passes  
### Render layer editor
When a shot is animated in a 3D program for a professional production, it is rarely rendered out as is. Instead, the shot is divided into layers and/or render passes. In Maya, the Render Layer Editor allows you to create and manage various render layers and render passes.

![rp01](img/maya/rendering/comp_car_luminance.png), ![rp02](img/maya/rendering/comp_car_shadow.png)

Final realistic render image:

![ex01](img/maya/rendering/GUID-59AF3E15-AFFB-4ABE-BDCC-EED3B16B0B2F-low.png)

Another powerful tool to use in conjunction with this is the ability to hide objects from render. This lets you use very high-quality settings for only some parts of the image. 

![layer01](img/maya/rendering/layer01.png)  
(Upper left) Diffuse layer render. (Upper right) Shadow layer render. (Middle left) Specular layer render. (Middle right) Blended layers result. (Bottom) Render Layer Editor. Diffuse layer Blending Mode is set to Normal. Shadow layer Blending mode is set to Multiply. Specular layer Blending Mode is set to Screen. 

### Z-depth map

Images from Advanced Maya® Texturing and Lighting, Second Edition by Lee Lanier, 2008

Using Z-depth maps, you can recomposite the image back together. You can use it to fake the depth of field by blurring some parts of the image and not others; render bubbles drifting in a scene; or render an object with motion blur moving behind glass – the transparency makes motion blur effects take a long time, but if you render the glass on a different layer that problem is solved. Many special effects such as particles are also more efficient to render separately. Computer-generated effects are incorporated into live footage using layers.

Render layers are best used to isolate geometry, shaders, and lighting to create different versions of the same animation. Render layers can be used to create a balance between efficiency and flexibility. You have an enormous amount of creative flexibility when using render layers. 

You can create and manage render layers using the Layer Editor in Render mode (called the Render Layer Editor). With render layers, you can assign any object to multiple layers with a different material on each layer. This lets you create multiple images for each frame, from any combination of Maya's four renderers, third party plug-in renderers, and post-processes such as Fur and Paint Effects.

![ren](img/maya/rendering/renpss.png)  
It shows overlapping of two render layers.

### Render passes
Render passes divide the output created by a render layer into separate images or image sequences. Using render passes, you can separate the reflections, shadows, diffuse color, ambient occlusion, specular highlights, and so on into images or image sequences, which can then be reassembled in compositing software. By separating things such as the reflections from the diffuse color, you can then exert maximum creative control over how the different images work together in the composite. This approach also allows you to make changes or variations easily or fix problems in individual elements rather than re-rendering the entire image or sequence every time you make a change.

### Render layout overview 

**A system of per layer and per object overrides** means that objects can have different shading and rendering attributes on different layers.    
With **render layers**, you can assign any object to multiple layers with a different material on each layer. This lets you create multiple images for each frame, from any combination of Maya's four renderers, third party plug-in renderers, and post- processes such as Fur and Paint Effects. Rendered images can be efficiently organized for output to a compositor. Render layers can be also be rendered to Adobe® Photoshop® (PSD) format, which supports multiple image layers.     
As well, a preview composite of all the layers can be viewed in the Render View.

# Lab
## To do list
- Lab practice A: Using Batch Bake to bake an ambient occlusion texture  
- Lab practice B: Baking occlusion from high to low res models	
- Lab practice C: Using a surface shader to bake an ambient occlusion texture in the Hypergraph  

-----------------------
## Ambient Occlusion shading
There are several ways to apply ambient occlusion.  

You can download the toad object files from here: [toad high resolution](obj/toad.obj), [toad low resolution](obj/toad_low.obj)

## Lab practice A: Using Batch Bake to bake an ambient occlusion texture 
Let's create ambient occlusion map by using Batch Bake (mental ray).  
Where: Rendering // Lighting/Shading / Batch Bake (Mental ray)  

### Using your baked occlusion map using Photoshop
- Once the bake is completed open the project file that you specified earlier.     
- In that folder, select RenderData > MentalRay > lightmap > select your baked texture file and open this with Photoshop.      
- Drag the Occlusion bake on top of your model's texture layer(s) and select Multiply as the layer blending mode. You may also want to apply a slight Gaussian blur to your occlusion layer, especially if it being used on an organic surface. For hard sharp edged surfaces like this one no blur was applied.

## Lab practice B: Baking occlusion from high to low res models  
Maya help [Create texture maps with the Transfer Maps editor](http://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2016/ENU/?guid=GUID-B011A4BC-1B7A-4EC3-9B73-BCF744886C84)   
Where to create your normal map:   
Command: Rendering // Lighting/Shading / Transfer Maps... 

- Ambient occlusion maps can also be used to complement normal maps. The occlusion values from a high poly model can be baked to the UV layout of a low poly model. This helps to sell the normal mapped details if used in a subtle way. This function is found in the **transfer maps** window under lighting/shading in the Render menu set.

## Lab practice B: Using a surface shader to bake an ambient occlusion texture in the Hypergraph 
Related tutorial: [Ambient Occlusion in Maya - by Alchemist101 (2011).](http://www.game-artist.net/forums/spotlight-articles/1317-tutorial-ambient-occlusion-maya-alchemist101.html) 
### Setting up the shader network
- First open the hypershade window and from the Maya nodes list MMB drag **a Surface Shader node** into the work area.   

![aop01](img/maya/rendering/sshd.png)

- Change it to MentalRay nodes, then under the textures tab MMB drag an '**mib\_amb\_occlusion**' node onto the work area.

![aop02](img/maya/rendering/mib.png)

- **Connect the 'OutValue' of the Occlusion node to the 'OutColor' of the surface shader**. This is the default connection between these 2 nodes so you can do this by simply holding down Ctrl and MMB dragging the occlusion node over the shader node. 

![aop03](img/maya/rendering/mib_link.png)
       
### Setting up your scene
- In order to get good results from Ambient Occlusion the scene environment must be white. To do this open the Outliner window and select the Persp camera. In the attribute editor under the Environment tab slide the Background Color to 100% white.
- If you use the occlusion render pass, you don't need to change the Background color. 

![aop11](img/maya/rendering/cam.png)

- Now open the Render Globals window and **select MentalRay** as your renderer and Production as the quality preset. Now change the multipixel filter to "Lanczos". 

![aop12](img/maya/rendering/lanz.png)

- Now close the render Globals window and assign the 'Surface Shader' you have setup to your model. It should turn the model completely black.

### Tweaking
- Frame your model and hit render. It can look grainy.
- Now we need to tweak the settings a little. Open the attribute editor of the Ambient Occlusion node. 
- The **'Spread'** setting affects how far the occlusion shadow spreads over the surface. 
- The **'Samples'** setting will remove the grainy look but will drastically increase render times.

----------------------
## General guide for the final project

- Cleaning the file: proper naming, and delete the history once it is ready.

- Modeling details: Work on good proportion. Adding bevels to smooth edges. Apply smoothing if it is a curved surface. If it is NURBS surface, rebuild it by increasing number of spans, or if it is polygon, either do smooth or smooth proxy, or by manually adding more divisions or edges.

- Cinematography: redefine your camera set-up (file gate) and match it to the render setting (resolution gate). Check that your lighting shows good balance and overall contrast, helps viewers to focus on the main objects, and reveals important details in your scene. Finally try to create good soft shadows.

- Shading & rendering: define and reveal proper material characteristics and when you do render, properly apply ray tracing, direct or indirect illumination if it fits, and most of all don't forget to apply anti-aliasing. Try to use photoshop in order to utilize multiple render passes too.

Overall, work on it until you are pleased with your final render result.
