# A.
## Goal
- To understand and apply ways to obtain non-conventional modeling data in Maya, by using visual effect tools such as Paint effect and dynamics. 

---------------
## Visual effet
In a broader sense, visual effects refers to digitally-created special effects that recreate natural phenomena that are too complex for standard 3D modeling, rigging, animation, and rendering techniques. Such phenomena might include the flash flood of a valley, the explosive collapse of a building, the eruption of a super-volcano, the plying of an ancient ship on stormy seas, or an angry swarm of giant insects. These effects might appear in a live-action feature film, a 2D or 3D animated feature film, an independent short film, a scientific visualization, or a cross platform video-game.

## Paint effect
**Paint Effects** is a powerful tool that allows you to interactively paint specialized strokes that create complex geometry as a post-process. Numerous Paint Effects brushes are included with Maya and are grouped in such categories as trees, flowers, weather, and fire.

![pe01](img/maya/pe/comp_butterflyhill.png)

You can use Paint Effects as a traditional paint program to paint images on a canvas, or to paint repeatable textures that you can apply to geometry in your scenes.

### Paint Effect attributes
After you create a Paint Effects stroke, you can edit the look and movement of the effect through the Attribute Editor. There are a large number of attributes to edit with Paint Effects.

- Select the stroke, and open the Attribute Editor. Switch to the stroke’s tab to the brush attributes.

A summary of some Paint Effects attributes:

**Brush Profile** gives you control over how the tubes are generated from the stroke; this is done with the Brush Width attribute. This makes tubes emit from a wider breadth from the stroke to cover more of an area.

**Shading** and **Tube Shading** gives you access to the color controls for the tubes on a stroke.

- **Color1 and Color2** from bottom to top, graduates from Color1 to Color 2 along the stalk only: The leaves and branches have their own color attributes, which you can display by choosing **Tubes / Growth**.
- **Incandescence1 and 2** Adds a gradient self-illumination to the tubes.
- **Transparency1 and 2** Adds a gradient transparency to each tube.
- **Hue/Sat/Value Rand** add some randomness to the color of the tubes.

**Tubes**: you’ll find all the attributes to control the growth of the Paint Effects. 

- In the **Creation** subsection, you can access the following:       
- **Tubes per Step** controls the number of tubes along the stroke.     
- **Length Min/Max** controls how tall the tubes are grown.    
- **Tube Width1 and Width2** controls the width of the tubes.   
		
- In the **Growth** subsection, you can access controls for branches, twigs, leaves, flowers, and buds for the Paint Effects strokes. Each attribute in these sections controls the number, size, and shape of those elements. Although not all Paint Effects strokes create flowers, all strokes contain these headings; some may or may not be active.
	
- In the **Behavior** subsection contains the controls for the dynamic forces affecting the tubes in a Paint Effects stroke. Adjust these attributes if you want your flowers to blow more in the wind.


#### Additional Notes
> Although Paint Effects brushes can create convincing results, they are unable to cover large areas effectively. For example, you can use the tool to paint patches of grass, weeds, or trees, but filling the entire park, meadow, or forest would be impractical in terms of render times and render stability.

> Paint Effects are rendered as a post process, which means they won’t render in reflections or refractions as is. 

> You can also **convert Paint Effects to polygonal surfaces** that will render in the scene along with any other objects so that they may take part in reflections and refractions. To convert a Paint Effects stroke to polygons, select the stroke and choose **Modify / Convert / Paint Effects to Polygons (or to NURBS, or to Curves)**. The polygon Paint Effects tubes can still be edited by most of the Paint Effects attributes mentioned so far; however, some, such as color, don’t affect the poly tubes. Instead, the color information is converted into a shader (you can check or edit the shading information with its textures from the Hypergraph) that is assigned to the polygons. It’s best to finalize your Paint Effects strokes before converting to polygons, to avoid any confusion.

> Paint Effects is a strong Maya tool and you can use it to create complex effects such as a field of blowing flowers. A large number of controls to create a variety of effects come with that complexity. Fortunately, Maya comes with a generous sampling of preset brushes. Experiment with a few brushes and their attributes to see what kinds of effects and strange plants you can create.

> Also Maya has really good documentation about Paint Effects in the Help files.

### Deformation, Blend Shape 

Blend Shapes are essentially copies of your main character geometry with specific, focused changes to a small part of the geometry. e.g., facial expressions.

## Advanced topic: Bifröst & XGen
### Bifröst

**Bifröst** is a procedural framework that can create simulated liquid effects using a FLIP (fluid implicit particle) solver. You can generate liquid from emitters and have it fall under gravity, interact with colliders to direct the flow and create splashes, and use accelerators to create jets and other effects.

### XGen
**XGen** is a geometry instancer that lets you populate the surface of polygon meshes with an arbitrary number of primitives either randomly or uniformly placed. XGen lets you procedurally create and style hair, fur and feathers for characters. For set dressing, XGen lets you quickly populate large-scale environments, including grass savannas, forests, rocky landscapes, and debris trails.

## Brief history 
Maya began as part of Alias Research, Inc. that ironically was first developed for the Mac. The code was ported to IRIX (the porting process was code named Maya) and joined to Wavefront Technologies, Inc., upcoming 3D technology. Silicon Graphics, Inc., which at the time was really a player, was battling it out with Microsoft, which had just acquired a rival high-end product, SoftImage.

Maya then only ran on SGI IRIX machines, which is where most old timers first encountered Maya. The first time I used Maya was on an IRIX box on a Silicon Graphics Octane machine, which (at the time) was stunningly expensive. The Octane was many thousands of dollars, and Maya was charging a per-seat license that was thousands of dollars per year. Our lab had three machines and three licenses, and the budget was well over $ 100,000.

Early in its life cycle, Maya made some stunning market expansions. Maya 1.0 was released in 1998 (then usually referred to as Alias|Wavefront Maya) and quickly won high-profile clients such as Industrial Light and Magic and Tippet studios from SoftImage. By the way, SoftImage after freeing itself from Microsoft has made a real resurgence and has some really amazing technologies. Ironically, it too has recently been acquired by Autodesk — and thus is now the step-cousin of Maya, which was acquired by Autodesk in 2005.

Since 1998, Maya has been through many iterations and some confusing “Complete” and “Unlimited” editions. It made its way to Windows and into a Mac OSX version. Now, it has settled into a single version and is released as an updated version nearly every summer. Nowadays, Maya is not versioned by number, but by year — Maya 2012 is the current version as of this writing.

## What Maya is
Maya aims to be a one-stop shop, and indeed, it is an incredibly robust, powerful, flexible, customizable, expanding, and complicated tool. Most any emerging tool in 3D — from particles, to cloth, to hair, to fluids, to motion tracking — finds an early iteration in Maya. Maya is very quick to develop and exploit new techniques and ideas.
Now sometimes, this move to be on the bleeding edge can be a problem. Yeah, fluid effects are awesome — but it can be pretty hard to use for the uninitiated and takes a huge amount of development horsepower for Maya developers. And at the end of the day, how many projects really use fluid — or need realistically rendered fluid effects? In the past, this has meant that as Maya has chased the newest big things, old things like modeling tools have remained in very static forms as other competing softwares (who aren’t necessarily chasing the absolute latest technology) refined their core modeling, texturing, and animation tools. For a while there, this was of great frustration as Maya showed new cloth simulations but still had modeling tools that were 10 years old, and indeed, many animators and animation houses found that supplementing Maya’s tools with other more specialized tools was a good thing.
Luckily, especially since their Autodesk acquisition, Maya has made some good progress in continuing to evolve their core tool sets. It is this set of core tools (modeling, texturing, animation, and rendering) that is the basis of all 3D projects and the technology we will be exploring through this volume.
So, for our purposes, Maya is a 3D-production tool that allows us to model forms, texture them to indicate surface qualities, animate those forms, and render out the frames to sequential stills. Note that it is not a game engine (you can’t really export a game from Maya). However, Maya allows for assets (including animated assets) to be exported in a variety of formats that can then be imported into various game engines and made interactive.

## What you need to run it

In its evolution, Maya moved from IRIX to Windows, where of course its potential customer base increased dramatically (SGI machines were always powerful but expensive). More recently, it has also found a home on Mac OSX. Increasingly, the hardware required to run Maya has become available to the masses — regardless of your OS persuasion. One of the things I really like about Maya is that its cross-platform nature is pretty flawless. Generally, the keyboard shortcuts are even the same between Macs and PCs. Files generally flow quite well from one platform to the other (although sometimes there are some strange inconsequential error messages that show up). I will frequently work with a student who worked on a Mac at home, worked on the project in class on a PC, sent it to me where I worked with it on my PC at home and continued working with it on my MacBook Pro at school the next day, only to pass it back to the student on a PC. Few problems arise. In fact, over the course of this book, some tutorials will be written using Maya 2012 for Mac and some with Maya 2012 for PC.
Having said that, hardware matters, although not in the ways you may think. At its core, hardware (for our needs) includes a) processor b) memory c) video card d) hard drive, and e) monitor.

## How Maya works
So Maya is robust. Maya is flexible. Part of the reason it’s accumulated this reputation is due to its nodal structure. This is a little different than how most 3D software works — shoot, it’s different than how most any software works.
Here’s the idea: when you do things in Maya, you essentially create a node. Maya keeps track of these nodes in something called History. What this means is that an object will build up a collection of nodes that can just be thought of as a collection of instructions. So here’s where it gets interesting. In most applications, let’s say five things were done to an object. If there was a mistake in Step 2, it can be undone by using the Undo function to go back to that step. However, to get back to the state of things where they were earlier, the next three steps have to be done again.
In Maya, these five steps are all indicated by nodes that are accessible via the Channels Box and Attribute Editor. By selecting one of these nodes, the parameters of that node become accessible and editable. When changed, Maya automatically uses the new information in that node to recalculate all the rest of the nodes attached — it recalculates all the other instructions that are “downstream” of the instruction just altered.
Indeed, this is a powerful idea, but has a few restrictions. Objects collecting these nodes — collecting this history — can slow Maya down. Every change the user makes essentially causes Maya to relook at everything it’s done to the object and redo it again.
It also means that things have to happen pretty linearly in many cases. For instance, if a model is done and then rigged and skinned, so that there are joints deforming the mesh, and then the UV map is altered (thus changing how the texture is applied to the surface), Maya distorts the model first (as per the joints) and then applies the texture (as per the UV map), but the UVs at this point are no longer in the same place as when they were applied (they’ve been deformed by the joints). What this means is that the texture crawls across the form and doesn’t stay where it was intended to be.
Now, both of these examples are solvable. Maya allows models to be worked on without saving the History. Further, even if the History is saved through the process, if things get slow, the History can be deleted. In the joints/UV example, recent versions of Maya allow for “Non-Deformer History” to be deleted — essentially allowing changes like UV map adjustments to no longer be dynamically calculated which means the texture won’t crawl across the surface as it is deformed.
The core idea here is to remember this nodal structure as we will be referring to it often through the coming tutorials. It’s central to Maya’s design and, like any powerful tool, when used correctly can be intensely useful or amazingly problematic if not considered.

## What Maya do

### An Overview of Visual Effects
Visual effects is imagery created or adjusted for a film or video that cannot be obtained during a live-action, real-world shoot. The current visual effects industry creates such imagery, with the majority of the work produced digitally through 3D animation programs, such as Autodesk Maya, and 2D compositing programs, such as Autodesk Composite. The industry produces visual effects for theatrical motion pictures, television programs, television commercials, and various on-demand online content.
In a broader sense, visual effects refers to digitally-created special effects that recreate natural phenomena that are too complex for standard 3D modeling, rigging, animation, and rendering techniques. Such phenomena might include the flash flood of a valley, the explosive collapse of a building, the eruption of a super-volcano, the plying of an ancient ship on stormy seas, or an angry swarm of giant insects. These effects might appear in a live-action feature film, a 2D or 3D animated feature film, an independent short film, a scientific visualization, or a cross platform video-game.
Hence, this book will tackle visual effects in two forms: visual effects designed to stay within Maya and visual effects intended to be integrated with live-action footage. The first seven chapters include three tutorials that introduce you to the majority of Maya’s visual effects tools. The effects are applied to pre-built 3D scenes and are not exported. In contrast, the last three chapters cover a single tutorial that creates visual effects within Maya for the purpose of exportation and compositing with video footage.

Many of the visual effects created in this book are time-intensive—they either slow down the interactive playback of the timeline or they take a significantly long time to render. Here are some steps you can take to make sure your work flow is efficient:
Alter the render resolution. Start with a small resolution, such as 640×360, and work your way up to larger resolutions, such 1280×720 or 1920×1080.
Render small regions when testing. Use the Render Region function in the Render View. (Click drag a red marquee box in the Render View render area and click the Render Region button.)
Temporarily lower the render quality. With Maya Software, change the Edge Anti-Aliasing menu to different quality presets. With mental ray, alter the attribute settings within the Sampling section of the Quality tab (Maya 2014) or change the Quality Presets menu at the top of the Quality tab (Maya 2013 and earlier). Raise the render quality once the visual effects have been adjusted.
Temporarily hide unwanted objects. Alternatively, create display or render layers to divide the objects among layers that you can turn on or off. Render layers are discussed in Chapters 1, 2, and 10.
Create Playblast movies (Window > Playblast) when the timeline playback is slow.
Employ Dynamics or nDynamics caches. Caches save the motion of objects, such as nParticles, in memory. When a simulation is cached, you can play the timeline in reverse or start the playback on a late frame. Caches are discussed in Chapter 10.
When working with Dynamics and nDynamics systems, reduce the number of dynamic items. For example, try to work with fewer nCloth objects, particles, or Fluid Effects container voxels. Many Dynamics and nDynamics components have their own quality settings. Start with low-quality settings and work your way up to high-quality. These settings are discussed throughout this book.
Although these techniques are mentioned when they are the most critical to efficiency, feel free to apply them at any time.

-----------------

## Lab practice A: Creating paint effects.  
### To apply paint effect brushes on to a surface
1. Create NURBs patch (increase its size and span numbers). 
2. Select the surface and apply **Modeling // Generate / Make Paintable**.
3. Choose **Modeling // Generate / Get Brush**, then the **Visor** window will open. Select a brush style from the brush folder.
4. Click+drag the mouse over the chosen surface. The Paint Effects stroke is laid over the surface, and the Paint Effects tube will grow from it. When you release the mouse button, the stroke is ended. You can add additional strokes by click+dragging again. You can retrieve a new brush style at any time from Get Brush. You can delete a stroke by selecting the associated stroke node in the Hypergraph or Outliner.
5. Render a test (Paint Effects is supported by Maya Software, but not mental ray). 

![pe01_01](img/maya/pe/visor.png)

***- You can convert the paint effect to other meshes such as Polygons, NURBS, or Curves (Modify / Covert /) which you can use in other pipelines.***

## Practice: Paint effect animation
![pe01](img/maya/pe/texture.png)

1. From the Visor, click the grasses / grassWindWide.mel brush. 
2. In the Perspective window, click and drag at least two lines across the grid to create two Paint Effects strokes of blowing grass. 
3. From the Visor, Select the flower / africanLily.mel brush in the Flower folder. 
4. Click and drag a new stroke between the strokes of grass.
5. Render a frame using Maya Software. Render out a 120-frame sequence to see how the grasses and flowers animate in the wind. 

__________________
## Lab practice B: Creating low poly effects.
### Low poly in Maya

> basically this is what you need to do. [Reference link](http://simplymaya.com/forum/showthread.php?t=39592)

1. Select all the vertices on your mesh (or the ones you want that applied)
2. Go to Edit Mesh > Transform Component > option box
3. Select the random factor (you can change that later)
4. Move the vertices to the form you want
5. Select the mesh then go to Mesh > Triangulate
6. Select the mesh again then got to Mesh > Reduce (adjust options for different results)
